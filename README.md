# Capstone Project
The Capstone Project is the largest undertaking you'll experience in the Ada classroom. Not only is it a month long, but you will be your own product owner. It will be up to you to decide (with input from instructors, mentors, and TAs) what gets built when (and how).

### Learning Goals
- Demonstrate self-direction, time management, and independent learning
- Learn and implement new technologies
- Complete a product lifecycle from conception to delivery
- Utilize agile practices learned to assist in project completion

### Deliverables

#### Once
- [Project Concept](concept.md)
- [Product Plan](product-plan.md)

#### Weekly
- A demo of your progress to your capstone teams every Friday
- Your PM may attend these demos
- A half-hour one-on-one with your PM

#### Daily
- In lieu of formal standups with your PMs, you will complete this [daily checkin form](https://goo.gl/forms/16zh694GtKsMYKqj2) __before noon Monday through Friday, and once over the weekend.__ This is a non-negotiable requirement.

### Final Delivery
The Capstone Project consists of the following components:
- Completed application, live on the web
- The source code of your project on Github, with:
  - Clear documentation on how to setup/install your project
  - Any third-party dependencies or configuration required
  - A link to your Trello board
  - A link to your Product Plan
- If your capstone includes a hardware component, you must complete these additional requirements:
  - Parts list, with links, for the device(s)
  - A markdown document with step-by-step instructions for assembling, verifying, and integrating the device(s) with your project
- [Product Plan](product-plan.md): problem statement, user persona(s), market research
- [Project Presentation](presentation.md), a demo of the application and pertinent information about your project

### Accountability Teams
You'll be assigned to a three or four person team. For the duration of capstone, your team members will serve as your sounding board, rubber ducks, and first-responders for your project. You are expected to be responsive to requests for help from your team (within reason), and to utilize the expertise of your teammates when you need help.

### Process Guidelines
- Use your product plan to lead the functionality development of your application
- Create and maintain a Trello board to document progress on your project
- Practice TDD to lead the development process

### Technical Guidelines
- Review the information on [technology stacks](tech-stacks.md)
- Decide on a technology stack that meets the [Capstone requirements](tech-stacks.md#capstone-requirements)
